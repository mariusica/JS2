2. Write a function that will take two strings as parameters and will return their concatenation, with a space between it, all in upper case. 


<script>
function text(txt1,txt2){
		var txt = txt1 + " "+ txt2;
		return txt.toUpperCase();
        } 
document.write(text("happy","testing"))  
</script>
